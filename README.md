<h1 align="center">   Hello </h1>
<h2 align = "center">I made this silly little code to save some time on searching the same words on many different websites. I use it to search for Funko Pops but you can change it to whatever you want. I created it using selenium. In future I will add some more features, so stay tuned!</h2>
<br><br><br>
<h1>This code can be divided into two segments</h1>
<h2>
<ul>
<li> A database - a table filled with dictionaries. Each one of those consists of a site http, a type of identifying search bar, and a string that is the content of the selected type.
<li>Find_Pop - a function that basically writes the same phrase into search boxes on all of those websites. You need to pass it a site http, type of identifier, the content of type and the phrase that you search for. Currently, it enables only types of ID, NAME, CLASS, XPATH.
</ul>
Feel free to use it in any way you want :)
